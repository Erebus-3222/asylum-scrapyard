# asylum-scrapyard
A modification/fork of jim-recycle that pays cash per task plus a chance for other items.


Edited to be a scrapyard in city.
Pays cash + random chance for items configurable
May be a little sloppy since it was chopped up but will update changes I make

Thanks to Jim for the original script.
